# bracketing
Basic tool which lets you effectively rank a list of items and by only showing you two items and a time.

Inspired by the work of Tom Scott and his video *1,204,986 Votes Decided: What Is The Best Thing?*
--> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALy6e7GbDRQ. In this video he references the work of Evan Miller and his article *How Not To Sort By Average Rating* https://www.evanmiller.org/how-not-to-sort-by-average-rating.html. The goal is to create a tool that uses the "better" technique described in this article.
